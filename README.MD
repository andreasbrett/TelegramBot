# TelegramBot

Telegram is a secure messenger. For quick notifications from my bash/python/... scripts I created this **tiny**
framework.

## Examples

Please see **example.py** for examples on how to send messages via Telegram. Please note that all
those examples use sample values. If you run these without modification **they will not work**.

## Creating your Telegram Bot

In order to create a Telegram Bot you will have to connect to [BotFather via Telegram](https://telegram.me/botfather).
Once you are connected it will guide you through the process of setting up your bot. You will have to provide your bot's...

- Name
- Username

Afterwards you will receive your Access Token. The process literally takes a minute. Once created just start a chat with your
bot and fetch the chat ID as shown in the examples.
